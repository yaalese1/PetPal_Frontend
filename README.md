# PROJECT TITLE: Pet & Date 
# VIDEO DEMO: https://www.loom.com/share/8bea74f88e864ac3865dcc7a03eec389

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION :

Do you remember when you were a kid and you really wanted a pet but your parents always said no? Whether it was because they thought you weren't responsible enough or because they couldn't afford it, it was always a disappointment. But now there's a solution! With this app, you can explore different domestic animals that are available for temporary care in your city. This is great for lenders who may  need a break from taking care of their own pets or just want to go on a quick weekend getaway without having to worry about finding a sitter in time. It's a flexible and spontaneous way to enjoy the company of animals without the long-term commitment. But wait, there's more! As you know, most pet owners have a deep love and bond with their four-legged friends, so why not create similar bonds with fellow animal lovers? The app has a dating feature that allows lenders to join the pet session, but it's completely optional. We hope this application suits your needs perfectly!



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

<!--
### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
